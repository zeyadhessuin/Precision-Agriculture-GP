# Precision-Agriculture-Graduation-Project
Our Graduation Project at Faculty of Engineering (Computer Engineering Department)/ Aswan University, class 2023

Before the advent of precision agriculture, farmers faced numerous challenges that hindered their ability to maximize crop yields and minimize losses. These problems included inefficient use of resources such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides, resulting in increased costs and environmental pollution. Additionally, traditional farming practices often relied on guesswork or subjective assessments, leading to inaccurate predictions of crop growth and yield. This made it difficult for farmers to make informed decisions about their farming practices, resulting in suboptimal crop yields and reduced profitability. Moreover, traditional farming practices were often labor-intensive, requiring significant manual labor and time. This led to low productivity and increased costs. Overall, the challenges associated with traditional farming practices highlighted the need for more efficient and precise agricultural techniques, which led to the development of precision agriculture.
When trying to find a solution to this issue. The main goal of the proposed system project is to address this issue, and it does so by combining Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) technologies and Web Services. The implementation strategy is based on the use of a low-cost camera and sensor system to identify the type of plant, determine whether it is sick, as well as its solid status and make decisions in accordance with that status.
